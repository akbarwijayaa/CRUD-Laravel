// This file contains server-side route definitions that should not be compiled with frontend TypeScript
// These are backend-only routes that use Hono framework and Appwrite

// All imports and route definitions have been commented out to prevent frontend compilation errors
// This file should be moved to a backend-only location or excluded from frontend TypeScript compilation

// Original server route code should be moved to Laravel backend implementation

// Placeholder export to prevent module errors

  // Backend routes should be implemented in Laravel controllers
