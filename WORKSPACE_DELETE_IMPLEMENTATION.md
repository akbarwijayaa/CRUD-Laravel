# Workspace Deletion Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented delete workspace functionality for the Laravel application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (Laravel)

#### Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- Added API route for deleting workspaces: `DELETE /api/workspaces/{workspace}`
- Route name: `workspaces.api.destroy`
- Middleware: `auth`, `verified`

#### Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/WorkspaceController.php`)
- Implemented `destroy(Workspace $workspace)` method
- Features:
  - Authentication check
  - Image file deletion (if exists)
  - Cascade deletion of related records (handled by database constraints)
  - JSON response for API calls
  - Redirect response for form submissions
  - Proper error handling
  - Smart redirect logic (creates workspace if none remaining)

#### Database
- Foreign key constraints already in place for cascade deletion:
  - `projects` table: `workspace_id` cascades on delete
  - `tasks` table: `workspace_id` cascades on delete
  - `workspace_user` table: `workspace_id` cascades on delete

### 2. Frontend (React/TypeScript)

#### Hook (`resources/js/feature/workspaces/api/use-delete-workspace.ts`)
- Added CSRF token support
- Updated success handler to use backend redirect response
- Improved query invalidation
- Proper error handling

#### Form Component (`resources/js/feature/workspaces/components/edit-workspaces-form.tsx`)
- Already had delete functionality wired up
- Uses `useDeleteWorkspace` hook
- Confirmation dialog implemented

## API Endpoint

```
DELETE /api/workspaces/{workspace}
```

### Request Headers
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`
- `Accept: application/json`
- `X-CSRF-TOKEN: {token}`

### Response (Success)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Workspace deleted successfully",
  "redirect": "/" // or "/workspaces/create" if no workspaces remain
}
```

### Response (Error)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to delete workspace: {error_message}"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required (middleware: `auth`, `verified`)
- CSRF token protection
- Basic authorization check (authenticated users only)
- Note: In production, consider adding more granular permissions

## Error Handling
- Database errors caught and returned as JSON
- File deletion errors handled gracefully
- Frontend displays appropriate toast notifications

## Testing
- Route registered successfully
- PHP syntax validation passed
- Frontend TypeScript properly typed

## Features
- Deletes workspace and all related data (projects, tasks, memberships)
- Removes associated image files
- Handles last workspace scenario (redirects to create page)
- Responsive frontend with loading states
- Confirmation dialogs for user safety

## Notes
- Database foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Image deletion is handled but gracefully continues if file doesn't exist
- Frontend invalidates React Query cache for proper state management
- Redirect logic handles edge cases (no workspaces remaining)
